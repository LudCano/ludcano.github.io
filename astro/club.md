# Astronomy club
<i>Club de Astronom√≠a Planetario Max Schreier</i>
<br>
Starting from 2022, I (re)founded the faculty's astronomy club, since I was a freshman I participated on it, but when the last coordinator graduated (and during the pandemic) the club was unactive.
<br>
Under the guidance of the Planetarium's director I started a new generation of the club, with a focus not only in learning more about astronomy but also in developing research skills, which is important and sadly is not taught in our faculty.
By the end of 2023, the club has around 40 members, from which I consider 20 as active, they come to our activities and also do some little projects on their own.
<br>
Again, as I'll graduate soon I'll look for a new coordinator soon.
