# The Bolivian Asteroid Search Campaign
This is the Bolivian version of the International Asteroid Search Campaign, a project led by <a href="https://iasc.cosmosearch.org">International Astronomical Search Collaboration</a>. I started this project in 2018 and since then we have had more than 3000 students participating in the campaign, and most importantly, 25 asteroids got discovered by our participants.

This project wouldn't be the same without my fellow collaborators, and since September 2023 I'm no longer the coordinator of the campaign, now the campaign is led by <a href="mailto:egianella@fcpn.edu.bo>E. Gianella</a>, N. Villavicencio & A. Raysel.

The faculty's planetarium also helps on the coordination and logistics of the campaign.
