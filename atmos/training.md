# Python Training for Data Analysis  

From April to June 2024 I had the chance to train undergraduate students in Data Analysis with Python, these 11 students then participated in the **2024 Student Field Campaign** led by [Dr. David Whiteman](https://profiles.howard.edu/david-whiteman) (for more information about the project, check out this blog). The training was given in English.

After the campaign the students took the class "Meteorological Instrumentation I", for which I was a teaching assistant, for that semester we kept working with more data and techniques.

The objective of the course was to teach students different techniques for data analysis using Python, in total we had around 5 sessions, starting from Python basics and ending in regression and more complicated plots. Students also had the chance to work with datasets from previous versions of the campaign, when asked.

This short training will be updated for 2025, the repository is free for using and I'm open for comments and suggestions to improve it!

**Sessions:**

 1. [Week 1](https://github.com/LudCano/LFA-python-short-course/blob/main/Week1.ipynb) Focuses on the basics of Python, how to use Jupyter Notebook and use of variables.
 2. [Week 2](https://github.com/LudCano/LFA-python-short-course/blob/main/Week2.ipynb) was a session for learning how to open a file manually and start with the use of the Pandas library.
 3. [Week 3](https://github.com/LudCano/LFA-python-short-course/blob/main/Week3.ipynb) focuses in time management in Python (how to manage Datetime objects, timedeltas, etc.), also the students learned how to do simple plots.
 4. In [Week 4](https://github.com/LudCano/LFA-python-short-course/blob/main/Week4.ipynb) students learn to do more complicated plots (subplots and play with axis). This was the last "regular session".
 5. More scripts developed during the course "Meteorological Instrumentation I" will be uploaded soon! (Correlations, statistics and smoothing).
