# LIDAR ANALYSIS LA PAZ
The LIDAR instrument is located at UMSA CAMPUS (16.538026 S, 68.069879 W), and is managed by the <a href="http://www.atmosfera.umsa.bo/wp/">Laboratory of Atmospheric Physics</a> (<i>Laboratorio de Física de la Atmósfera (LFA) in spanish</i>), this project consists on the migration and doing changes to the code developed on MATLAB by M. Sánchez, and it's supervised by R. Forno, research professor from LFA.

The code is now on Python and can read, denoise, average, and display a Quicklook plot for both polarization channels from the instrument, and can also calculate the depolarization radio and save an auxiliary plot. It has an interactive and non-interactive mode to run the code more simply, the group is also receiving a guide from J. Yoshitaka, a collaborator of the Laboratory.

With this instrument, we had the chance to get data from the smoke event that occurred during Sep-Oct 2023, which according to our measurements, made La Paz one of the cities with the worst air quality in the world.
