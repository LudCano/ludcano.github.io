I studied Physics at Universidad Mayor de San Andr√©s (UMSA), in La Paz, Bolivia. My main interests are Atmospheric Physics and (Radio) Astronomy, on which I did my undergraduate thesis. 
During my major, I worked mostly on astronomy research and outreach. Still, on the last couple of years I also got interested in AtmosPhys and I had the chance to work with the [Laboratory for Atmospheric Physics at UMSA](http://www.atmosfera.umsa.bo/wp/) that manages the [Chacaltaya Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) Station](http://www.chacaltaya.edu.bo). I also had the chance to work with the LIDAR instrument located at the University Campus, mostly working on the code for the data analysis.
