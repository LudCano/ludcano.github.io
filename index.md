I'm finishing my major in Physics at Universidad Mayor de San Andr√©s (UMSA), in La Paz, Bolivia. My main interests are Atmospheric Physics and (Radio) Astronomy, on which I did my undergraduate thesis. 
During my major I worked mostly on astronomy research and outreach, but on my last couple of years I also got interested in AtmosPhys and I had the chance to work on the LIDAR instrument located at my University Campus, mostly working on the code for the data analysis.

## Astronomy
Some of my projects on astronomy are:
### Undergraduate Thesis:
[Structure and Kinematics of a Jet -  Accretion Disk System](/thesis)
<br>
We studied waters masers around a low-mass Young Stellar Object (Class 0 - I).
