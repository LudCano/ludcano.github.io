## Undergraduate Thesis
### Structure and Kinematics of a Jet -  Accretion disk system
**Project description:** For my undergraduate thesis, I worked with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0m8ORQ0AAAAJ&hl=es&oi=ao">G.N. Ortiz-Leon</a> to study the behavior of water masers around two YSO (Young Stellar Objects): CARMA 6 & CARMA 7. Using observations with the <a href="https://public.nrao.edu/telescopes/vlba/">Very Long Baseline Array</a> we can reach angular resolutions in the order of fractions of milliarcseconds, which is great to resolve these masers.

The water maser emission has a wavelength of 22.2GHz, but as we can get data from different wavelengths, if we detect the emission in a different channel, then using the Doppler effect we can assume that that certain emission has a different velocity (getting closer or further), and with that we can try to study (using the Disk Wind model) from which distance of the star does that emission got ejected from the disk.
