## Undergraduate Thesis
### Structure and Kinematics of a Jet -  Accretion disk system
For my undergraduate thesis, I worked with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0m8ORQ0AAAAJ&hl=es&oi=ao">G.N. Ortiz-Leon</a> to study the behavior of water masers around two YSO (Young Stellar Objects): CARMA 6 & CARMA 7. Using observations with the <a href="https://public.nrao.edu/telescopes/vlba/">Very Long Baseline Array</a> we can reach angular resolutions in the order of fractions of milliarcseconds, which is great to resolve these masers.
