## Undergraduate Thesis:
[Structure and Kinematics of a Jet -  Accretion Disk System](/thesis)
<br>
We studied waters masers around a low-mass Young Stellar Object (Class 0 - I).

## Geometrical Approximation of the North Galactic Pole by Means of Stars From a Galactic Disk
[More about this project](/rbfpaper)
<br>
This was my first peer-reviewed paper as first author, and is currently published in the Bolivian Journal of Physics <i>(Revista Boliviana de FÃ­sica)</i>. On this paper I developed a simple (geometrical) model to approximate the North Galactic Pole using pairs of stars that meet certain requirements.
